### üõ†Ô∏è Commands

- **Nyxi**: This command serves as the entry point for the **vscode-nyxi** extension. It provides access to the following commands:
  - **Install [nyxi]**: Installs project dependencies using the appropriate package manager for your project. It utilizes the [@nyxb/nyxi](https://github.com/nyxb/nyxi) package to perform the installation with the correct package manager based on your project's lockfile.
  - **Run [nyxr]**: Runs scripts defined in your project's `package.json` file.
  - **Execute [nyxlx]**: Downloads and executes a package.
  - **Upgrade [nyxu]**: Upgrades packages to their latest versions.
  - **Uninstall [nyxun]**: Uninstalls packages from your project.

### üìú Menus

The **vscode-nyxi** extension also adds menu items to the explorer and editor context menus for easier access to its commands. You can find these menu items under the "Nyxi" or "Nyxi Commands" group.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The **vscode-nyxi** extension automatically detects the package manager being used in your project based on the presence of a lockfile (`yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `package-lock.json`, or `bun.lockb`). It utilizes the corresponding package manager to execute the commands.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è How it works

The **vscode-nyxi** extension leverages the functionality provided by the [@nyxb/nyxi](https://github.com/nyxb/nyxi) package to execute the package manager commands directly within Visual Studio Code. It intelligently determines the appropriate package manager based on your project's lockfile and executes the corresponding commands when you invoke the commands from the command palette or the context menus.

By using the **vscode-nyxi** extension, you can seamlessly manage your project's dependencies, run scripts, upgrade packages, and perform other package management tasks without leaving the Visual Studio Code environment. The **Install [nyxi]** command ensures that the project dependencies are installed using the correct package manager for your project.
